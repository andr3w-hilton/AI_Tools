```

## How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Check if Tkinter is installed:
```bash
python -m tkinter
```
This should open a small test window. If not, you need to install Tkinter.

### Run the game:
```bash
python battle_ships_gui.py
```

Or with specific Python version:
```bash
py -3.12 battle_ships_gui.py
```

## How to Play

### Starting a Game

1. **Launch the game** - Run the Python script
2. **Configure settings**:
   - Select board size (6-15)
   - Choose game mode (vs AI or Practice)
3. **Click START GAME**

### Gameplay

1. **Click on enemy grid** (left side) to fire at that location
2. **Watch for results**:
   - Red cell = Hit
   - White cell = Miss
   - Status message shows what happened
3. **Your ships** are visible on the right (gray cells)
4. **AI automatically fires** after your turn (in vs AI mode)
5. **Win by sinking** all enemy ships before AI sinks yours

### During Game

- **Status bar** shows whose turn it is and last action
- **Stats** update in real-time below each board
- **Hover over cells** to see targeting highlight
- **Click "New Game"** to return to menu

## Game Modes

### vs AI Mode
- Play against intelligent computer opponent
- AI uses hunting strategy to find and sink your ships
- Both boards are active
- Take turns with AI

### Practice Mode
- Play without AI opponent
- Focus on finding enemy ships
- Learn ship placement patterns
- No pressure gameplay

## Ship Fleet

### Standard Board (9+)
- Patrol Boat: 2 cells (Red)
- Destroyer: 3 cells (Brown)
- Submarine: 3 cells (Purple)
- Battleship: 4 cells (Green)
- Carrier: 5 cells (Gold)

### Small Board (6-8)
- Destroyer: 2 cells
- Submarine: 3 cells
- Battleship: 4 cells

## Statistics Tracked

For each board, the game tracks:
- **Total Shots** - Number of guesses made
- **Hits** - Successful shots on ships
- **Misses** - Shots that hit water
- **Accuracy** - Hit percentage
- **Ships Sunk** - Number of ships destroyed vs total

## Tips for Playing

1. **Don't cluster shots** - Spread out initial guesses
2. **Follow up hits** - When you hit, check adjacent cells
3. **Watch patterns** - AI might reveal patterns in its strategy
4. **Count ships** - Track which ships you've sunk
5. **Use corners** - Ships often spawn near edges

## Advantages Over Terminal Version

| Feature | Terminal | GUI |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Visual Appeal | Basic text | Colorful graphics |
| Input Method | Type coordinates | Click cells |
| Board View | Text grid | Visual grid |
| Feedback | Text messages | Colors + messages |
| Ease of Use | Requires typing | Point and click |
| Learning Curve | Steeper | Gentle |
| Mobile Friendly | No | No (desktop app) |
| Mistakes | Easy to mistype | Hard to misclick |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Click** - Fire at cell
- **New Game** button - Return to menu
- **X** (close window) - Exit game

## Troubleshooting

### Tkinter Not Found
**Error**: `ImportError: No module named tkinter`

**Solution**: Install tkinter
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`

### Window Too Large
If the game window doesn't fit your screen:
- Use smaller board size (6-8)
- The cell size automatically adjusts

### Slow Performance
- Close other applications
- Use smaller board size
- Ensure Python is up to date

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions:
- **Manual ship placement** - Drag and drop ships before game
- **Animations** - Explosions, water splashes
- **Sound effects** - Shots, hits, explosions
- **Themes** - Different color schemes
